## 1. What is the main difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
<br/>

    1. SQL databases are relational databases,
    whereas NoSQL databases are non - relational databases.

    2. SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based,
    key - value pairs,
    graph databases
    or wide - column stores.This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key - value pair,
    documents,
    graph databases
    or wide - column stores which do not have standard schema definitions.

    3. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

    4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

    5. SQL databases uses SQL (structured query language) for defining
    and manipulating the data,
    which is very powerful.In NoSQL database,
    queries are focused on collection of documents.


## 2. What are some of the benefits of using NoSQL databases over traditional SQL databases?

<br/>


    The benefits of using NoSQL databases over traditional SQL databases are as follows:

    1. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and flexible as compared to SQL databases.

    2. NoSQL databases are highly available and are easy to manage.

    3. NoSQL databases are easy to scale horizontally.

    4. NoSQL databases are easy to use and are very fast.

    5. NoSQL databases are highly reliable and are easy to maintain.


## 3. What are the four main types of NoSQL databases, and what are their key characteristics?

<br/>

    1. Key - Value Stores

    Key - value stores are the simplest type of NoSQL database. They are also known as key - value pairs or associative arrays. In this type of database,
    the data is stored in the form of key - value pairs. The key is used to retrieve the value. The value can be a string, a document, a JSON object or any other data type.

    2. Document Stores

    Document stores are the most common type of NoSQL database. They are also known as document oriented databases. In this type of database, the data is stored in the form of documents. The documents are stored in a collection. The documents are stored in binary JSON format. The documents are stored in a collection. The documents are stored in binary JSON format. The documents are stored in a collection. The documents are stored in binary JSON format.

    3. Wide - Column Stores

    Wide - column stores are the most popular type of NoSQL database. They are also known as column family databases. In this type of database, the data is stored in the form of columns. The columns are stored in a column family. The columns are stored in a column family. The columns are stored in a column family. The columns are stored in a column family.


    4. Graph Databases

    Graph databases are the most popular type of NoSQL database. They are also known as graph oriented databases. In this type of database, the data is stored in the form of nodes and edges. 



## 4. What is the CAP theorem, and how does it relate to distributed systems?

<br/>

    CAP Theorem:

    The CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees, i.e., Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.

    Distributed systems are the systems that are made up of multiple computers that are connected to each other. These systems are used to solve complex problems. The CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees, i.e., Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance.



## 5. What are the three properties of the CAP theorem?

<br/>

    The three properties of the CAP theorem are as follows:

    1. Consistency

    Consistency means that all nodes in the distributed system see the same data at the same time. This means that if a client updates a record on one node,
    then all other nodes will see the updated record at the same time.


    2. Availability

    Availability means that every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information.


    3. Partition tolerance

    Partition tolerance means that the system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.


## 6. What are the BASE properties, and how do they relate to the CAP theorem?

<br/>

    BASE Properties: BASE is an acronym for Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventual consistency. The BASE properties are as follows:

    1. Basically Available

    Basically available means that the system guarantees availability for every request, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information.


    2. Soft state

    Soft state means that the state of the system may change over time, even if no operation was performed on the system.


    3. Eventual consistency

    Eventual consistency means that the system will eventually be consistent if no new updates are performed on the system.
